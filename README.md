## Hello to the 3 people who ever read this, I am Revalutionary

  I love programming a lot and so ever since I started it I've wanted to conquer a bunch of new programming languages one by one. Unfortunately I suck at learning this stuff so I'm not too familiar with many languages at all. In fact I can only say I am an expert with one: Python, but I am trying to learn C++ right now and hope to learn Rust after that (don't ask why I chose these I just did). I'm a contributer to a Geometry Dash list known as "The Shitty list" (TSL) where I add a bunch of records every once in a while.

  I'm a pretty boring person but I guess outside of programming I like playing music and doing competitive math which is probably why I butchered the spelling of half of these words.
